# $\color{Cerulean}{\text{EE1101: Circuits and Network Analysis -- Course Wiki}}$
Hi there! 
Welcome to IITH. This course marks the beginning of a unique experience at IITH. For better or for worse, this course is the only one of this kind. 


> [!CAUTION]
>This course will be very intensive. (Contrary to other courses) If you want a good grade, you must put in much more time and effort.
>Be inquisitive. Ask questions. Doesn't matter if they are bad. Also, answer in class. Doesn't matter if the answer is terribly wrong. You'll understand the reason later.

## $\color{Cerulean}{\text{Course Content}}$
Honestly? We don't know what sir plans on covering in the course. To be even more honest, sir barely knows what he'll cover during the course. But the basic topics you can expect to learn are the following. 
* Basic Circuital understanding
* KCL and KVL
* 2 Port Network Analysis
* Operational Amplifiers
* RLC Circuits (Sinusoidal Steady State analysis)
  * Laplace Transform
  * Fourier Transform

Besides the actual contents of the course, you will also learn 
* Python as a tool for visualisation
* C
* $\LaTeX{}$ : A scripting language, standard for writing research papers, and now your assignments.

## $\color{Cerulean}{\text{Course Work}}$
The work you are expected to do will mainly consist of the following
* "Online Assignments" : These are the questions given to you in the `#question-assign` channel of Discord. Further instructions [here](#colorceruleantextworking-on-online-assignments)
* "Hardware Assignments" : These are circuits that you are supposed to build in the lab. More information [here](#colorceruleantextworking-on-hardware-assignments)



## $\color{Cerulean}{\text{Working on Online Assignments}}$
Begin with messaging `/getquestion` in the channel `#question-assign`. The Course Bot will get back to you in approximately 30 seconds. If it is your first time messaging the bot, the response should be something like this 

![getquestion For New Users](Figures/Working%20getquestion.png)
Your DMs should now contain the details of the question you have been assigned.

> Note
> * When you call the command, you now have 1 assigned question.
> * You can only have one active question at a time. Unless sir specifies the question is on hold, or until the solution is accepted, you cannot request another question. 


## $\color{Cerulean}{\text{Working on Hardware Assignments}}$
* The components and the circuit schematic will be provided (mostly). There is a chance that sir may ask you to design your own circuit. 
* There will be a viva-voce after the circuit building is done.
* You must maintain a handwritten Lab Report.

You will be evaluated on the demo of the circuit, the understanding you show during the viva, and your lab report.

> The lab work may be in pairs or in groups of 3 / 4. The lab reports must be written individually, the students will be questioned individually 
 
> [!TIP] 
> Experiment a lot with the circuit given. Try to improve it. Try to make changes and see what happens. Measure every possible voltage or current you can. Document the process.
